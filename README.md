# __*Bootstrap/ jQuery Weather Dashboard*__

## Details About This Assignment
This homework was all about using Bootstrap, jQuery, using AJAX to make multiple API calls to OpenWeatherMap. I had to make an API call to get the current weather, including weather icon, temperature, and wind speed. I also had to make a single API call to grab the current UV Index for the current city that was requested. There was also another API call that was made to grab the next 5 day weather forecast and display them day-by-day. I also utilized local storage to save the last searched city.
